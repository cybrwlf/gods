### Personal Input

I like to play many RTS games such as : Starcraft : Brood Wars, AOE2 : Expansion, and Homeworld. I like first person shooters, such as UT and Quake3 (which I am god when i play), I also like Counter Strike (a mod for Half-Life - awsome), and of course the best space sim / first person shooter : FreeSpace2. Other then playing games, my other hobbies are networking, and building computers. I have gotten into a real bad habit of constantly upgrading my hardware to maintain a faster machine.

### Quotes
1. I know how to use a keyboard now!
2. Damn you Fluxy!
3. You don't exist!
4. Reality is the essance of thought.
5. Don't cry about it bitch!
