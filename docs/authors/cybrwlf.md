### Personal Input

I dunno why no one likes driving with me. I thought doing figure eights in the car right after the computer show in a major snow storm was fun! It was so much more fun then loading the car with 4 people and 4 full PCs(Montiors, Cases, the works), but we that we did too.

### Quotes
1. Passing some of the snow plows is ok … Just don’t try to pass ALL the snow plows!
2. No prob
3. Assumtion is the mother of all f*ck-ups!
4. basicly…
5. WTF?!?!
